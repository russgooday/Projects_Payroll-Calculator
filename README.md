## Payroll Form Calculator
The project started out as question on the sitepoint forum, which I got involved in.

The forum post can be found here at [sitepoint](https://www.sitepoint.com/community/t/calculation-function-dead-end/352969/64?u=rpg_digital) (my *username* ***rpgdigital***). It subsequently lead to me being commissioned to do the full project.

### The task
The payroll element to the project required that on changing various input fields that a sequence of calculation be performed, updating a column of output fields.

I have recently refactored the code into a cleaner modular format utilising a more functional and flexible approach to programming.
